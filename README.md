ML-Driven Behavioral Analysis and Fraud Detection for Credit Card Users: A Comprehensive Approach to Customer Segmentation and Sentiment Optimization
  

## Overview  
TransVision is a machine learning-based framework designed to optimize the end-to-end transaction journey for credit card users. By analyzing transaction data, detecting fraudulent patterns, and conducting sentiment analysis on customer feedback, it provides actionable insights for enhancing customer satisfaction and improving security.  

---

## Features  
- **Transaction Optimization:** Real-time analysis of transaction patterns to identify spending trends.  
- **Fraud Detection:** Robust algorithms to safeguard against anomalous activities, ensuring secure transactions.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping users by socio-economic attributes for personalized services.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Insights from customer feedback to improve user experience.  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset for this project was synthetically generated using the **Faker** library. It replicates real-world financial environments and includes:  
- **Transaction Data:** Unique IDs, timestamps, categories, and amounts.  
- **Customer Attributes:** Age, gender, loyalty scores, and socio-economic details.  
- **Feedback:** Review texts and ratings to simulate user satisfaction trends.  
- **Fraud Indicators:** Flags for anomalous transactions to train fraud detection models.

## Methodology  
1. **Behavioral Analysis:**  
   - Transaction patterns and seasonal trends were analyzed to identify user behaviors.  
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) was predicted using financial metrics.  
2. **Fraud Detection:**  
   - Machine learning models detect anomalies based on irregular transaction amounts, locations, and frequencies.  
3. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   - NLP techniques were applied to customer reviews to extract actionable insights.
